		<p>Quantum cryptography is a powerful tool for secure communication. However, it is not without its limitations in the ideal model.
			We are exploring how quantum cryptography can be <b>more powerful</b> in the a somewhat <b>realistic</b> model where the adversary has limited quantum resources.

	<div class="research-item svelte-1ri4gue"><h2 class="svelte-1ri4gue">Formal Proofs for Transformers</h2>
		<p>Transformers have taken the world by storm recently. However, they are not without their flaws. Specifically, proving any 
			general statement, even when restricting to a specific model, is quite challenging. We are leveraging existing work 
			and new techniques to prove formal statements about the behavior of specific transformers given their weights.

	<div class="research-item svelte-1ri4gue"><h2 class="svelte-1ri4gue">Effective Distance Preservation of Weight Reduced Codes and Higher Dim HGPs</h2>
		<p>Good quantum error correcting codes often have high weight stabilizer. This results in more expensive measurements and as such, a higher effective error rate.
			Starting with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10030">Hasting&#39;s work</a>, we show effective distance preservation for weight reduced codes and higher dimensional hypergraph product codes.
			See the paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02193">arXiv</a>.
		</p></div>
	<div class="research-item svelte-1ri4gue"><h2 class="svelte-1ri4gue">Multiparty Secret Leader Election</h2>
		<p>Work done while at the Ethereum Foundation with Mark Simkin to improve communication cost of secret leader election for multiple leaders.
			The work resulted in a novel data independent and oblivious priority queue.

	<div class="research-item svelte-1ri4gue"><h2 class="svelte-1ri4gue">Addressing Stopping Failures for Small Set Flip Decoding of Hypergraph Product Codes</h2>
		<p>Work done with Anirudh Krishna and Michael Beverland to improve speed and decrease word error
			rates for
			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00822">hypergraph product codes (also known as quantum expander codes).</a>
			Work had an order of magnitude improvement in decoding rates and speed. The paper was presented
			at a poster in QIP 2024. The paper can be found on
			<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00877.pdf">arXiv</a>.

	<div class="research-item svelte-1ri4gue"><h2 class="svelte-1ri4gue">Weighted Secret Sharing from the Wiretap Channel</h2>
		<p>With Fabrice Benhamouda and Shai Halevi, we introduced a novel connection between weighted
			secret sharing and wiretap channels. Achieving a ramped weighted secret sharing scheme, we
			eliminate dependence on the number of parties and use little public information. The paper was
			presented at Information-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC) 2023 and the paper can be found on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1578.pdf">ePrint</a>.

	<div class="research-item svelte-1ri4gue"><h2 class="svelte-1ri4gue">3D Turtles and Drawing Math</h2>
		<p>A fun side project, I explored whether a sequence of movements to an object generated by
			rational numbers will form a closed path. Surprisingly, the question of closure is initmatly
			connected to discrete logs and roots of a very specific multinomial with coefficients of +/-
			1. The paper can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Lev-Stambler/3D-Turtles/blob/master/paper/Paper.pdf">Github</a>. With a friend <a href="https://www.shivaperi.com/">(Shiva Peri)</a>, we also created a
				visualization which creates some rather beautiful shapes. We also posted an
				<a href="https://3dturtles.groked.co/">interactive website</a> to play around with parameters.
